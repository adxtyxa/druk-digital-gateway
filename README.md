Druk e-Residency: A Web3 Digital Identity System for Bhutan
Project Overview
Druk e-Residency is a pioneering full-stack web application designed to establish a secure, decentralized digital identity and service platform for Bhutan. Inspired by the nation's philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), this system champions user sovereignty, transparency, and efficiency in the digital realm. Its design is clean, minimalist, and deeply influenced by the rich cultural heritage and serene landscapes of Bhutan.

Key Features
Secure Web3 Onboarding: Seamless KYC process integrating Metamask wallet verification.

Decentralized Identity (DID) Creation: Users receive a unique, self-sovereign digital identity linked to their crypto wallet.

Profile Upgrade & Digital Citizenship Path: Allows users to provide additional verifiable details for a more comprehensive digital profile.

Dynamic e-Residency Certificate: On-demand downloadable PDF certificates, embedded with verifiable DIDs and cultural aesthetics.

Business e-Residency: A distinct Web3-authenticated pathway for businesses, complete with a dedicated decentralized identity and dashboard.

Integrated Web3 Services: A suite of innovative services leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced functionality.

Intuitive User Interface: A responsive and visually appealing design inspired by traditional Bhutanese art and architecture.

Working FAQ & Support Bot: Immediate assistance and information access for users.

Technical Architecture
The Druk e-Residency system is engineered with a modern, robust, and scalable stack, emphasizing decentralization and security:

Frontend: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a highly customizable, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing user interface across all devices.

Backend & Database: Powered by Node.js for server-side logic and utilizing Supabase as the PostgreSQL database and authentication layer. Supabase handles user management, data storage, and provides a secure API gateway.

Web3 Integration: Leverages Ethers.js (or Web3.js) for seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling Metamask wallet connections, message signing, and transaction initiation.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): A core component that facilitates user-controlled digital identities, enabling verifiable interactions without central intermediaries.

How It Works
Core Identity & Verification
Metamask Wallet Connection: Upon initiation, users connect their Metamask wallet. A unique cryptographic challenge (nonce) is generated by the backend and sent to the user.

Cryptographic Signing: Users sign this nonce with their Metamask wallet. This signature, along with the nonce, is sent back to the backend.

Signature Verification: The backend cryptographically verifies the signature against the nonce, recovering the user's wallet address and confirming ownership without ever handling private keys. This address is then linked to the user's account in Supabase.

Decentralized ID (DID) Minting: A unique Decentralized ID (DID) is generated for the user. This DID is then cryptographically signed by the user's Metamask wallet, binding it to their self-sovereign identity. The DID and its signature are stored securely.

Profile & Certificate Management
Profile Upgrade: Users can provide additional, higher-tier information (e.g., country of residence, GNH-relevant skills). This data is signed by the user's wallet, creating a verifiable declaration, and stored for future application processing.

Digital Certificate Generation: The system dynamically generates a beautiful PDF e-residency certificate. This process involves fetching user data, rendering an HTML template (infused with Bhutanese cultural designs), and converting it to a PDF for direct download. The certificate includes a QR code encoding the user's DID for external verification.

Business e-Residency
A dedicated flow for business registration. Business entities receive their own distinct Decentralized ID, also signed by the business owner's Metamask wallet, establishing a verifiable digital identity for their enterprise.

Why Druk e-Residency is Better
Druk e-Residency introduces a paradigm shift in digital governance, offering significant advantages over traditional systems:

User Ownership & Control: Individuals truly own and control their digital identity (DIDs) and personal data, rather than it being held by a central authority.

Enhanced Security & Privacy: Cryptographic verification and decentralized principles minimize reliance on passwords and reduce the risk of large-scale data breaches, while enabling selective disclosure of information.

Transparency & Trust: Key interactions and data (like notarized document hashes) can be recorded on public blockchains, fostering an environment of verifiable trust.

Global Interoperability: Utilizing open Web3 standards like DIDs allows for seamless interaction with other decentralized services worldwide.

Alignment with GNH: The system reflects Bhutan's commitment to well-being, sustainability, and community by promoting secure, transparent, and user-empowering digital interactions.

Future Enhancements: Backend Logic Explained
While some advanced services are conceptualized, their full implementation relies on clear blockchain and smart contract logic:

Smart Contract Notarization:

Logic: A dedicated Smart Contract deployed on a low-cost public blockchain (e.g., Polygon) would serve as the immutable ledger. When a document hash is notarized, our backend would send the hash and the user's signed proof to a function on this smart contract. The contract records the hash, the user's DID, and a timestamp.

Benefit: Provides irrefutable, globally verifiable proof of a document's existence and signatory at a specific time.

Druk Token Payments:

Logic: An ERC-20 compliant token smart contract would be deployed. The backend would integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges or fiat-on-ramps (e.g., via APIs from payment gateways like Transak) to facilitate token acquisition and enable wallet-to-wallet transfers within the platform.

Benefit: Establishes a native, transparent digital currency for ecosystem services, reducing transaction costs and friction.

Decentralized Governance:

Logic: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) framework, implemented via a series of smart contracts, would define the rules for proposal submission, voting mechanisms (e.g., one-DID-one-vote or weighted voting), and execution. The backend would interact with these contracts to present proposals and record votes.

Benefit: Enables direct, transparent, and auditable participation of e-residents in the digital governance of the system.

Lightning Network Integration:

Logic: The backend would either operate its own Lightning Network Node or connect to a third-party LN service via API. This would allow for the generation of actual Lightning invoices and the processing of instant, near-zero-fee Bitcoin transactions for e-residency services.

Benefit: Provides highly efficient, low-cost micro-payments, leveraging the speed of the Lightning Network.

Carbon Credit Trading:

Logic: ERC-20 or ERC-1155 smart contracts would represent tokenized carbon credits. A smart contract-driven marketplace (a Decentralized Exchange or custom contract) would facilitate buying, selling, and offsetting these credits. The backend would interact with these contracts for credit management and display public blockchain data.

Benefit: Creates a transparent, verifiable marketplace for environmental offsets, ensuring accountability and supporting Bhutan's ecological goals.

Blockchain-backed Certification & Verifiable Credentials (VCs):

Logic: Trusted institutions (e.g., government bodies, universities) would act as "Issuers," each with their own DID. They would issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which are digitally signed data packets containing verified claims (e.g., academic degrees, professional licenses) to the e-resident's DID. E-residents ("Holders") would store these VCs in a self-sovereign wallet. Any "Verifier" could cryptographically confirm the VC's authenticity by checking the Issuer's signature on the blockchain.

Benefit: Empowers individuals with control over their credentials, enhances privacy by enabling selective disclosure, and reduces fraud in digital attestations.
